**## Machine Learning Methods for Protein Structure Prediction**

- Hidden Markov models
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machine




**1 D Vector Machine Learning**
	Input = protein primary sequence
	Output =  sequence of predicted features for each amino acid in the sequence

 

Many protein structural feature predictions are 1-D prediction problems, including, for example, secondary structure prediction, solvent accessibility prediction, disordered region prediction, binding site prediction, functional site prediction, protein domain boundary prediction, and transmembrane helix prediction.
